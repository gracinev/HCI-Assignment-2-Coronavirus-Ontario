## Description
Coronavirus Ontario is an iOS application that aims to provide statistics and education regarding COVID-19 in Ontario.
The application allows for users to check on the daily statistics regarding COVID-19 in both Ontario and Canada. Users have the ability to see up-to-date statistics of total cases, active cases, resolved cases, and COVID-19 deaths. Focusing on education, the app contains valuable information regarding what Coronavirus is and how to prevent the spread of the virus. Finally, the application allows for the user to chat with a volunteer about COVID-19 concerns, as well as to call a volunteer toll free.

## Five New Desirable Functionalities
Five new desirable funcationalities that I have not seen before in any other COVID-19 related applications includes:
  1. Ability to use virtual reality to check if someone has coronavirus symptoms by using their phone camera 
  2. Local or virtual volunteer opportunities relating or unrelated to COVID-19 (ex. assisting in temporary COVID-19 shelters)
  3. Ability to search for Coronavirus cases specially in ones city or region
  4. Ability to track what phase of reopening your city and or regio
  5. Ability for a user to record where they have been in the past two weeks. This would be useful in the event of an outbreak in a business so that the user can track if and when they have been to that business 
  6.. Given that technology in phones have advanced, ability for users to check ones temperature through their phone
